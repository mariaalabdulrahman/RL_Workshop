# RL_Workshop
Robotics Society Reinforcement Machine Learning Workshop

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning Workshop brought to you by the Robotics Society! 
In this workshop, you will dive into the exciting world of reinforcement learning (RL) and gain hands-on experience by implementing RL agents for two classic examples: CartPole and Frozen Lake, using the OpenAI Gym toolkit.

Here's some additional information on these examples:

Frozen Lake: https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/

If you have any questions or need assistance during the workshop, feel free to ask the workshop organizers or refer to the provided documentation.

We hope you enjoy this hands-on reinforcement learning workshop and find it informative. Have fun implementing your agents and exploring the world of RL!
